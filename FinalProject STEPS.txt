/////
Create folders -> data,face_detector,model,output,test
data shld contain folders -> images,with_mask,without_mask
output shld contain folders -> test,train

/////
paste with and without mask images in their respective folders
paste 2 code files in files in file_detector (these file contains models to detect faces)

/////
install tensorflow in cmdprmpt

/////
code train_model.py

/////
in training code u can see in line numbr 23 till 30, give -d,-p,-m as arguments 
it is helpul in cmd promt to identify which folder is which.





/////
once everything is done the results should be,
in model folder ull have 3 files (alpha,beta and another)
in output under train folder ull have 3 plot graphs


/////
inside test folder put images that u need to test in jpg format


/////
now in cmdprompt,

python train_model.py -d short_dataimages

#this is for training
#now pass the image u want to detect masks

python detect_mask_image.py -i test/2.jpg 

##this above command takes 20min  so wait....
